      <description>&lt;p&gt;At my current workplace, which is critical national infrastructure in the UK, we have been investigating possible uses for LLMs and other AI systems. As a developer with a Graduate Degree in the subject, I have been assigned to investigate possible use cases for the business since the end of January&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this year. Throughout this process, and a not negligible amount of development with LLMs on the side, I have been increasingly less and less convinced by LLMs as something useful outside of very specific contexts, but that they&amp;rsquo;re not completely useless. In particular, I have found working with local LLMs to be a disappointing experience. This may be surprising to some readers, but I have found writing software systems with LLMs as an integral part of their operation to be a generally frustrating experience, even after implementing Prompt Engineering techniques suggested by figures such as Andrew Ng.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
